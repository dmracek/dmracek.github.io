We've all seen this movie. State-of-the-art (SOTA) natural-language processing (NLP) models are tremendously powerful, but there is a catch. They need lots of annotated labels or ratings from subject matter experts (SMEs) to train a model. Is there an easier way? Let's examine Hugging Face zero-shot learning ( ZSL ) to classify text responses in terms of the Big 5 personality traits without hand-crafted human annotations/labels/ratings. Classification as Natural Language Inference (NLI) The magic of ZSL is we can classify a text response in terms of a personality trait we didn't explicitly train a model to learn. No managing labeling projects?! Here is Joe Davison describing this NLI approach brought forth by Yin et al. (2019) . Quote The approach, proposed by Yin et al. (2019), uses a pre-trained MNLI sequence-pair classifier as an out-of-the-box zero-shot text classifier that actually works pretty well. The idea is to take the sequence we're interested in labeling as the \"premise\" and to turn each candidate label into a \"hypothesis.\" If the NLI model predicts that the premise \"entails\" the hypothesis, we take the label to be true. Big 5 Personality Data Let's use the SIOP 2019 machine learning competition data. These data include (1) scenario-based responses, and (2) more historically scaleable self-report questionnaire responses. Scenario Responses Over a thousand Mturkers were asked to respond, in their own words, to five open-ended work scenarios referred to as a situational judgment test ( SJT ) in the assessment industry. Each scenario question was designed to elicit behaviors in terms of a specific Big 5 trait. Specifically Agreeableness A colleague of yours has requested vacation for the same week as you. According to your supervisor one of you has to take a different week of vacation because it would be too busy at work if both of you are absent. Your colleague is not willing to change their vacation plans. What would you do and why? Conscientiousness You have a project due in two weeks. Your workload is light leading up to the due date. You have confidence in your ability to handle the project, but are aware sometimes your boss gives you last tasks that can take significant amounts of time and attention. How would you handle this project and why? Extraversion You and a colleague have had a long day at work and you just find out you have been invited to a networking meeting with one of your largest clients. Your colleague is leaning towards not going and if they don't go you won\u2019t know anyone there. What would you do and why? Emotional Stability or Neuroticism Your manager just gave you some negative feedback at work. You don\u2019t agree with the feedback and don\u2019t believe that it is true. Yet the feedback could carry real consequences (e.g., losing your annual bonus). How do you feel about this situation? What would you do? Openness The company closed a deal with a client from Norway and asks who would like to volunteer to be involved on the project. That person would have to learn some things about the country and culture but doesn't necessarily need to travel. Would you find this experience enjoyable or boring? Why? Self-report Responses Additionally, Mturkers responded to a self-report Big 5 personality questionnaire. Results We have a TON of responses for each scenario. What next? We'd love to have a team of experts evaluate responses in terms of each trait. A (0) would reflect a response is not agreeable whereas a (1) would reflect an agreeable response. However, let's say we don't have access to those resources. Enter zero-shot learning ( ZSL ). Recall the scenario above, \"A colleague of yours has requested vacation for the same week as you\u2026\" Let's score the agreeableness of those responses. Example Code & Responses The Python syntax is pretty simple Code ! pip install git + https : // github . com / huggingface / transformers . git from transformers import pipeline classifier = pipeline ( \"zero-shot-classification\" ) sequence = ( 'I would immediately tell my boss and colleague that if I am not able to take my requested vacation, ' 'then I will quit. I would explain to them that its unfair that I cant take a well needed vacation just because ' 'my coworker wants one. Also, I would question my boss as to why he believes it would be too busy at work if we ' 'both decided to take a vacation. Lastly, I would frankly tell them that I am not allowing my coworker to take ' 'a vacation at all and that I will not give in.' ) candidate_labels = [ 'agreeableness' , 'conscientiousness' , 'extraversion' , 'neuroticism' , 'openness' ] hypothesis_template = 'This response is characterized by {} .' classifier ( sequence , candidate_labels , multi_class = True , hypothesis_template = hypothesis_template ) ## output ## ## {'labels': ['conscientiousness', ## 'openness', ## 'extraversion', ## 'neuroticism', ## 'agreeableness'], ## 'scores': [0.9638389348983765, ## 0.9625383019447327, ## 0.7236202359199524, ## 0.619651198387146, ## 0.04535089433193207], ## 'sequence': 'I would immediately tell my boss and colleague that if I am not able to take my requested vacation, ## then I will quit. I would explain to them that its unfair that I cant take a well needed vacation just because my ## coworker wants one. Also, I would question my boss as to why he believes it would be too busy at work if we both ## decided to take a vacation. Lastly, I would frankly tell them that I am not allowing my coworker to take a ## vacation at all and that I will not give in.'} Probabilities ranging from .50 to 1.00 reflect agreeable responses whereas those between 0 and .50 reflect disagreeable responses For the specific example provided in the code directly above, the probability the agreeableness label is true is very low, 5%. Here's some more example responses and corresponding scores Examples of Agreeable Responses I would do it because I assume that my colleague must have asked first. I would ask my supervisor if that is the case and what the criteria was. I would honor the request with no problems if it was fair. I would take my vacation another week. Probability agreeableness label is true: 94% As far as company vacations are concerned, I think it should be \"the first to schedule it gets it,\" but I'd probably talk to my colleague and try to find out why that particular week is so important to him/her. It s/he is going somewhere for a wedding, an anniversary, or some other special occasion that can't be postponed, I'd probably let him/her take that week off and postpone my own plans. I don't have any family anymore, so I'm fairly flexible. Probability agreeableness label is true: 80% I would make another appeal to my supervisor. I would bring him/her ideas on how to cover with both of us being out for the week. If that fails, and knowing my coworker is inflexible, I would have to take a different week. I wouldn't be happy about it, but such is life. Probability agreeableness label is true: 57% Not Agreeable Responses I would ask them what they were doing on their vacation. If it was something important like a child's wedding or a birth and I didn't have important plans, I would let them go. If I had important plans and they didn't I would explain to them and to my boss that my plans were too important to switch. Probability agreeableness label is true: 46% It all really matters the reasoning behind my vacation. Do i have something planned and already bought for? Or was it just the spur of the moment? If it is already paid for and things, than I would ask to know who requested time off first. Whoever was last should be the one that changes their week. Probability agreeableness label is true: 10% I would immediately tell my boss and colleague that if I am not able to take my requested vacation, then I will quit. I would explain to them that it's unfair that I can't take a well needed vacation just because my coworker wants one. Also, I would question my boss as to why he believes it would be too busy at work if we both decided to take a vacation. Lastly, I would frankly tell them that I am not allowing my coworker to take a vacation at all and that I will not give in. Probability agreeableness label is true: 5% Wow! Upon first blush \u2013 this approach is working well! Let's look closer. Examining the Construct Validity of Our Measures Huh? Bear with me. Let's define construct validity as the degree to which a test measures what it claims to measure. An old-school psychometrician (See: Samuel Messick ) would want to examine the convergent and discriminant validity of scenario-based ( SJT ) and self-report measures. More simply, we want there to be a strong, positive relationship (i.e., convergence; correlations) between the ZSL scores and the scores on the self-report questionnaire. Convergent Validity Table below shows correlations between self-report ( rows ) and ZSL scores ( columns ). This is a stripped down version of a multitrait multimethod matrix (MTMM). Here is a nice reference that speaks to a MTMM . TLDR let's focus on the correlations on the diagonal with the icons. Further MTMM Comments The checks in the table below are along the validity diagonal and represent monotrait-heteromethod correlations. These are the correlations between two measures of the same trait measured with two different measures\u2013zero-shot inferences of SJT responses and a self-report questionnaire. Since we expect them to be measuring the same trait, they should be strongly and positively correlated. Generalizability Theory is another construct validity approach as well. Strong Convergence Moderate Convergence No Convergence Agreeableness Conscientiousness Extraversion Neuroticism Openness Agreeableness 0.14 0.06 0.07 -0.02 0.22 Conscientiousness 0.07 0.05 0.08 -0 0.13 Extraversion 0.04 0.01 0.24 -0.03 0.14 Neuroticism -0.06 -0.04 -0.16 0.01 -0.13 Openness 0.06 -0.01 0.05 -0.01 0.22 These relationships are very encouraging! Conscientiousness and Neuroticism traits likely didn't have strong convergent validity because the SJT prompts were worded too strongly and didn't end up promoting meaningful variability (Google: Walter Mischel strong vs weak situations ).
